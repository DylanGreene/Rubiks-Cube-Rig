# Rubiks-Cube-Rig

The files in the repository can be used with AutoDesk Maya (tested with 2015 and 2016).

To use the rig, open the script editor in Maya, and load the rubik.py script. I wrote this script to animate and rig the cube. It will also build the cube into any scene. A GUI will then appear which has all of the necessary functions to rotate, scramble, or solve the cube.

A video demonstration of this python script can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlYo_dohR4k
